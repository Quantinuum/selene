    This test checks that the simulator can handle a recursive function, and

    flow. The recursive code we use is a simple recursive function that measures
    a qubit, and then calls itself if the measurement is True. We output each measurement
    before checking the condition.

    The function should therefore always have exactly one False measurement (as the final
    output), and an arbitrary number of True measurements beforehand.
