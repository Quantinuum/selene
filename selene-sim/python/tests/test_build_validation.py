    """
    Selene sim builds are multi-step processes that
    are described by a build graph, with artifacts
    as nodes and build steps as edges.

    Artifacts have 'kinds' that allow an incoming
    artifact (e.g. passed to `selene_sim.build`)
    to be matched against in order to establish the
    build sequence.

    Examples:
      - An .ll file that is expected to depend on
        specific function signatures.
      - A .o file that depends on undefined functions
        that we expect to be defined after linking.

    By default, we only run artifact kind matching
    on the user input - this is because checking can
    be intensive (e.g. invoking system utilities to
    identify undefined functions in an object file, or
    parsing an LLVM file).

    If we pass `strict=True` to `build`, then outputs of
    steps are also checked against their expected kind.
    Here we do that test to ensure that standard builds
    and all of their intermediate artifacts conform to
    expectations - and, importantly, to ensure that the
    checks are working as intended.
